## Intro  

We naturally like to compare, rank and even name things "as the greatest". This is seen across all areas, domains, products, industry etc. One of the areas we see this most is in sports, where players are constanstly ranked and where a select few players are put in "Greatest of All Time" (GOAT) conversation. In fact, one of NHL's Wayne Gretzky's nicknames is "The Great One".  

Tom Brady is widely considered NFL's GOAT quaterback. His career accomplishments across the most statistical metrics are unrivaled. However, some consider Patrick Mahomes's career on a trajectory that can approach GOAT status. Patrick Mahomes has won 3 Super Bowls and was going for something that has never been accomplished: leading a team to three Super Bowls wins in a row. Super Bowl LIX completed about a month ago, where Mahomes's Chiefs got beat handily by the Philadelphia Eagles. Therefore, almost after Super Bowl LIX, the NFL Quaterback GOAT conversation was a topic discussed on various sports shows.

> üóíÔ∏è **Note:** The videos selected above are illustrative of the recent NFL quaterback GOAT debate. These debate videos were recorded after the most recent Super Bowl LIX, which does give us additional information (Mahome Super Bowl loss performance). However, these videos have recency bias that needs to be taken in consideration. In a few months, even if there aren't new NFL statistics to consider the recency bias will have somewhat worn off.  

## Background on Generative AI Used  

Artificial Intelligence was used to demonstrate the research process and final probabilistic forecast. All the tools that were used to generate this comparison can be found in OpenAI's ChatGPT platform. Specifically, the following features were used: 
* OpenAI GPT 4.5 Research Preview Model  
* Basic Prompt Engineering (Kept to a minium to give AI the most autonomy) 
* Deep Research (ChatGPT Pro Subscription) used 26 different web sources to gather the required intelligence  
 
OpenAI Deep Research is the highlight of the tools used. OpenAI Deep Research is essentially an opiniated AI Automation workflow. It works by refactoring the goal, spending time performing robust research using internet knowledge grounding and delivers a final comprehensive report to the user. The caveat with using Deep Research automation is that it can take several minutes to complete. In fact, I have seen it take up to 25 minutes on various research tasks. Additional time for AI to focus on your problem is essentially the tradeoff for a high quality answer.

The OpenAI Deep Research process armed with multiple automation steps and several tool calls greatly improves accuracy of the results. This is illustrated below on the benchmark results with *Humanity's Last Exam* data set. This benchmark is meant to be a very challenging benchmark of 2,700 highly curated questions. The questions in this benchmark are expert-level questions from a variety of domains. As clearly seen below, the Deep Research process greatly improves performance than individual AI models.

## Probability Assessment: Will Mahomes Become the GOAT?

Taking all the above into account ‚Äì championships, stats, awards, and the projected trajectory ‚Äì how likely is it that Patrick Mahomes surpasses Tom Brady as the consensus GOAT quarterback? It is certainly possible, but far from guaranteed. Brady‚Äôs combination of 7 titles and longevity records is an enormous benchmark for Mahomes or anyone to eclipse. Mahomes would likely need to win at least 5+ Super Bowls total (i.e. 2 or more additional championships in the coming years) and maintain elite play for another decade to build the statistical resume to rival Brady. Given Mahomes‚Äô talent and early success, he has a legitimate shot to approach those milestones. However, the NFL‚Äôs unpredictability (injuries, team changes, strong competitors) means we must temper expectations.

**Probability Estimate:** We assess the probability of Mahomes eventually overtaking Brady as the GOAT to be around ‚ú∂30%. This represents a moderate chance ‚Äì reflecting that Mahomes is on a Hall-of-Fame trajectory and is arguably ahead of where Brady was at the same point in his career, but also acknowledging that beating a legend‚Äôs legacy is exceedingly difficult. In other words, there‚Äôs roughly a one in three chance (in our estimation) that when Mahomes‚Äô career is over, the majority of fans and analysts will rank him above Brady.

**Explanation:** A ~30% chance accounts for both the upside and the hurdles. On one hand, Mahomes could continue to pile up MVPs and possibly reach 5 or 6 Super Bowl titles, which would put him in GOAT contention. For example, if Mahomes adds even two more rings (to reach 5) while also finishing top-3 all-time in yards and TDs, many would argue that his era dominance (and superior efficiency stats) make him the GOAT even if he falls short of 7 rings. On the other hand, there‚Äôs a strong possibility that Mahomes ends up with an extraordinary career that still falls just short of Brady‚Äôs legacy ‚Äì perhaps ending with on the order of 3‚Äì4 titles and top-5 passing totals. In that case, he‚Äôd likely be remembered as #2 all-time behind Brady. Indeed, after Mahomes‚Äô loss in Super Bowl LIX, commentators noted that Mahomes ‚Äúremains distantly behind Brady‚Äù in the GOAT race‚Äã ‚Äì he‚Äôs only halfway up the mountain in terms of rings (3 vs. 7)‚Äã.

### Overview of AI Deep Research Analysis

> üìú "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
>
> -- <cite>George E. P. Box (British statistician and thought leader recognized for his foundational contributions to statistical modeling)</cite>

I consider the "model" that OpenAI Deep Research was able to construct as very good. Why? With some prompt engineering, Deep Research was able to:
* Understand the key criteria to compare two NFL quaterback careers
* Gather Patrick Mahomes's career statistics and project realistic final career statistics 
* Cite the various internet knowledge stores used  
* Summarize the key metrics, rank them, communicate and present them in an easy to undertand table   
* Take all of the information into account and provide a final quantitative probabilistic estimate (30%)

Let's compare this to the analysis from major sports networks. When a major sports show is produced, many people prepare the analysis for a show. As you can see from the sample videos provided, a plularity of these sports experts do not even operate on half the analysis provided in the AI research above! The human sports analysis is often filled extremely subjective projections often missing key metrics to compare. This doesn't mean that this AI model is perfect. For example the AI reasearch didn't consider head-to-head matchups of Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes; or how Patrick Mahomes's reliance on mobility may lead to a steeper decline in QB play. These two latter comparision points were included in the human sports pundit analysis. However, this "model" that was AI generated is very comparable to the analysis found on major sports networks.  

We must consider costs when performing this analysis. Keep in mind a sports segment from a major news network that provided analysis on the Tom Brady vs Patrick Mahomes GOAT debate likely costs tens of thousands of dollars. This AI model was better for fraction of the cost and time; all it took was a few well crafted prompts!  


## Possible Model Optimizations paired with Artificial Intelligence 

While the Deep Research that OpenAI was able to perform was impressive, it would be unreasonable to claim that significant optimizations can't be made. Optimizations can be performed to improve both the approach and ultimate probability forecast (of Mahomes surpasssing Tom Brady). You can provide structure to the optimization in a worflow/process format and put AI in a position where it can excel (at the main analysis portions).  

* The statistical metrics used (Passsing Yards, Super Bowl Wins) are treated as indepdendent events. This is passable for "models" like this as some of the errors tend to average out. However, for optimal accuracy, they should be treated as highly dependent events. For example, in order for Patrick Mahomes's team to win the Super Bowl he would have presumably needed to win some playoff games and win season games (excluding extreme cases like just coming back for the Super Bowl to play). An obvious optimization is to build a model that considers these events as correlated and dependent.  
* It is possible to break the problem down into smaller components. Perform the Gathering of Intelligence (statistics), Simulating/Projecting of Patrick Mahomes's stats, Final metric comparison and final analysis communication could be done in several seperate steps. This would ensure that each step's quality is validated before passing on any intelligence and moving onto the next step.  
* Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to simulate Patrick Mahomes's remaining career statistics and achievements. This could create a range of probabalistic outcomes that includes a variety of contraints and rare events. For example, you could simulate Mahomes's career anchored on a typical quaterback aging curve. You could introduce "black swan" (rare) events like major injuries (Robert Griffin), suspensions (Michael Vick) or early retirement (Andrew Luck). 
* Most of these comparison metrics are single point estimations. For example, the AI generated model projects Patrick Mahomes to pass for 600 touchdowns (TDs). An estimate that provides a confidence interval range is a better estimate of uncertainty. As an example, a sophisticated simulation could show a 95% Confidence Interval of Patrick Mahomes ending with a range of 525-650 touchdowns to end his careeer.  
* Tom Brady's career is static and should be just extracted from a "historical ground truth" of statistics, rather than a scraping of web sites. In fact, 5 head-to-head games between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are static as well (unless Tom Brady un-retires). Tom Brady won 3 of those matchups and won 2 of the most important games; AFC Championship and the Super Bowl. These games are in the history books and should be materialized in a knowledge store that is made available for comparison analysis.  

The comparison between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes can also be approached using decision-making. This would allow the optimizations mentioned above to be introduced into various components of the Decision Intelligence Framework.
