| Career Metric             | Tom Brady (Final Career) | Patrick Mahomes (Projected Career) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Super Bowl Wins**       | 7 üèÜ                    | 5 (projected) <br> *Assumes two more championships to finish with 5 total* |
| **Super Bowl MVP Awards** | 5                       | 5 (projected) <br> *Likely earns MVP in most future SB wins* |
| **NFL MVP Awards**        | 3 (2007, 2010, 2017)    | 4 (projected) <br> *On pace to add 2 more to current 2 (2018, 2022)* |

| **First-Team All-Pro**    | 3                       | 5 (projected) <br> *Could lead NFL in QB play a few more times (2 so far)* |
| **Career Passing Yards**  | 89,214                  | ‚âà80,000+ (projected) <br> *Maintains ~4,000+ yards/year into late 30s* |
| **Career Passing TDs**    | 649                     | ‚âà600+ (projected) <br> *Continues 30+ TDs/year; potential to approach Brady‚Äôs total* |
| **Career Interceptions**  | 212                     | ‚âà180‚Äì200 (projected) <br> *Efficient turnover rate likely to continue* |

| **Passer Rating**         | 97.2                    | ‚âà100 (projected) <br> *Remains around 100 with sustained elite play (102.1 now)* |
| **Playoff Record**        | 35‚Äì13 (Most postseason wins ever) | 17‚Äì4 (as of 2025) <br> *Projected: ~30+ postseason wins if prime extends into late 30s* |
| **Playoff TD Passes**     | 88                      | 100¬± (projected) <br> *On track to break Brady‚Äôs record (46 TD in 21 games already)* |
| **Playoff Passer Rating** | 89.8                    | ~105 (projected) <br> *Likely remains around 100+ (currently 105.4, highest ever)* |

I consider this "model" that Deep Research was able to build very good. Why? Let's compare this to the analysis from major sports networks. Experts prepare analysis for a show and are experts in their fields and they do not even have half the analysis provided in the report above! The projections are wild guesses and key metrics are not included. 


## Future Optimizations

While the Deep Research that OpenAI was able to perform was quite impressive, there certainly are optimizations that can be performed to improve the analysis and ultimate probability forecast (of Mahomes surpasssing Tom Brady).  

**Possible optimizations**:  
* The metrics above are treated as indepdendent events. They should be treated as highly dependent events. For example, in order for Patrick Mahome's team to win the Super Bowl he would have presumablt needed to win some playoff games and win season games. An obvious optimization is to build a model that takes these depedenent and correlated metrics together.  
* Most of these metrics are single point estimations. For example, it projects Patrick Mahomes to pass for 600 Touch Downs (TDs). An estimate that provides a confidence interval range is a better estimate of uncertainty.  
* Break the problem down into smaller components. Perform the Gathering of Intelligence (statistics), Simulating/Projecting of Patrick Mahomes's stats, Final metric comparison and final analysis communication should be done in several seperate steps to improve quality and accuracy.  
* Tom Brady's career is static and should be just extracted from a "ground truth" of statistics rather than a scraping of web sites. Some interactions between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are static as well (unless Tom Brady un-retires). For example, their 5 head-to-head matchups where Tom Brady won the 3 most important games.
