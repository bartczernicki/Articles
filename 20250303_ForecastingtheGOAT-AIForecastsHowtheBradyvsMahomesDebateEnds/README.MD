I consider this "model" that OpenAI Deep Research was able to build as very good. Why? Let's compare this to the analysis from major sports networks. When a major sports show is produced, many people prepare the analysis for a show and the experts in sports fields fields and they do not even have half the analysis provided in the report above! The projections sometimes are extreme subjective projections often missing key metrics to compare. If you had shown the AI Deep Research analysis to a sports statistician, they could poke many holes in the approach and final forecast. However, realistically this "model" that was generated is likely better than most the analysis available and all it took was a couple of prompts; hence the cost was quite minimal.  


## Possible Model Optimizations

While the Deep Research that OpenAI was able to perform was quite impressive, there certainly are optimizations that can be performed to improve the analysis and ultimate probability forecast (of Mahomes surpasssing Tom Brady). You can provide structure to the optimization in a worflow/process format and put AI in a position where it can excel (at the main analysis portions).

* The comparison metrics above are treated as indepdendent events. This is passable for "models" like this as some of the errors tend to average out. However, for optimal accuracy, they should be treated as highly dependent events. For example, in order for Patrick Mahomes's team to win the Super Bowl he would have presumably needed to win some playoff games and win season games (excluding extreme cases like just coming back for the Super Bowl to play). An obvious optimization is to build a model that considers these events as correlated and dependent.  
* It is possible the problem down into smaller components. Perform the Gathering of Intelligence (statistics), Simulating/Projecting of Patrick Mahomes's stats, Final metric comparison and final analysis communication could be done in several seperate steps. This would ensure that each step's quality is validated before passing on any intelligence and moving onto the next step.  
* Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to simulate Patrick Mahomes's remaining career statistics and achievements. This could create a range of probabalistic outcomes that includes a variety of contraints and rare events. For example, you could simulate Mahomes's career anchored on a typical quaterback aging curve. You could introduce "black swan" (rare) events like major injuries (Robert Griffin), suspensions (Michael Vick) or early retirement (Andrew Luck). 
* Most of these comparison metrics are single point estimations. For example, the AI generated model projects Patrick Mahomes to pass for 600 touchdowns (TDs). An estimate that provides a confidence interval range is a better estimate of uncertainty. As an example, a sophisticated simulation could show a 95% Confidence Interval of Patrick Mahomes ending with a range of 525-650 touchdowns to end his careeer.  
* Tom Brady's career is static and should be just extracted from a "historical ground truth" of statistics, rather than a scraping of web sites. In fact, 5 head-to-head games between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are static as well (unless Tom Brady un-retires). Tom Brady won 3 of those matchups and won 2 of the most important games; AFC Championship and the Super Bowl. These games are in the history books and should be materialized in a knowledge store that is made available for comparison analysis.
