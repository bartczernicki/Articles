## Background on Generative AI Tools Used



Artificial Intelligence was used to create the research and model. All the tools that were used to generate this comparison can be found in OpenAI's ChatGPT platform. Specifically, the following features were used: 
* OpenAI GPT 4.5 Model  
* Deep Research (ChatGPT Pro Subscription) used 26 web sources to gather the required intelligence  
* Basic Prompt Engineering (Kept to a minium to give AI )

## Probability Assessment: Will Mahomes Become the GOAT?

Taking all the above into account ‚Äì championships, stats, awards, and the projected trajectory ‚Äì how likely is it that Patrick Mahomes surpasses Tom Brady as the consensus GOAT quarterback? It is certainly possible, but far from guaranteed. Brady‚Äôs combination of 7 titles and longevity records is an enormous benchmark for Mahomes or anyone to eclipse. Mahomes would likely need to win at least 5+ Super Bowls total (i.e. 2 or more additional championships in the coming years) and maintain elite play for another decade to build the statistical resume to rival Brady. Given Mahomes‚Äô talent and early success, he has a legitimate shot to approach those milestones. However, the NFL‚Äôs unpredictability (injuries, team changes, strong competitors) means we must temper expectations.

**Probability Estimate:** We assess the probability of Mahomes eventually overtaking Brady as the GOAT to be around ‚ú∂30%. This represents a moderate chance ‚Äì reflecting that Mahomes is on a Hall-of-Fame trajectory and is arguably ahead of where Brady was at the same point in his career, but also acknowledging that beating a legend‚Äôs legacy is exceedingly difficult. In other words, there‚Äôs roughly a one in three chance (in our estimation) that when Mahomes‚Äô career is over, the majority of fans and analysts will rank him above Brady.

**Explanation:** A ~30% chance accounts for both the upside and the hurdles. On one hand, Mahomes could continue to pile up MVPs and possibly reach 5 or 6 Super Bowl titles, which would put him in GOAT contention. For example, if Mahomes adds even two more rings (to reach 5) while also finishing top-3 all-time in yards and TDs, many would argue that his era dominance (and superior efficiency stats) make him the GOAT even if he falls short of 7 rings. On the other hand, there‚Äôs a strong possibility that Mahomes ends up with an extraordinary career that still falls just short of Brady‚Äôs legacy ‚Äì perhaps ending with on the order of 3‚Äì4 titles and top-5 passing totals. In that case, he‚Äôd likely be remembered as #2 all-time behind Brady. Indeed, after Mahomes‚Äô loss in Super Bowl LIX, commentators noted that Mahomes ‚Äúremains distantly behind Brady‚Äù in the GOAT race‚Äã ‚Äì he‚Äôs only halfway up the mountain in terms of rings (3 vs. 7)‚Äã.

## Overview of the Generated AI Model

I consider the "model" that OpenAI Deep Research was able to construct as very good. Why? While I did prompt the AI generation, it was able to:
* Understand the key criteria to compare two NFL quaterback careers
* Project Patrick Mahomes's career ending statistics
* Summarize the key metrics, rank them in a table 
* Take all of the information into account and provide a final quantitative probabilistic estimate (30%)

Let's compare this to the analysis from major sports networks. When a major sports show is produced, many people prepare the analysis for a show and the experts in sports fields fields and they do not even have half the analysis provided in the report above! The projections sometimes are extreme subjective projections often missing key metrics to compare. If you had shown the AI Deep Research analysis to a sports statistician, they could poke many holes in the approach and final forecast. However, realistically this "model" that was generated is likely better than most the analysis available and all it took was a couple of prompts. Keep in mind a sports segment from a major news network that provided analysis on the Tom Brady vs Patrick Mahomes GOAT debate likely costs tens of thousands of dollars. This AI model was better for fraction of the cost and time!  


## Possible Model Optimizations paired with Artificial Intelligence 

While the Deep Research that OpenAI was able to perform was impressive, it would be ridiculous to claim that significant optimizations can't be made. These optimizations that can be performed to improve both the analysis approach and ultimate probability forecast (of Mahomes surpasssing Tom Brady). You can provide structure to the optimization in a worflow/process format and put AI in a position where it can excel (at the main analysis portions).  

* The comparison metrics above are treated as indepdendent events. This is passable for "models" like this as some of the errors tend to average out. However, for optimal accuracy, they should be treated as highly dependent events. For example, in order for Patrick Mahomes's team to win the Super Bowl he would have presumably needed to win some playoff games and win season games (excluding extreme cases like just coming back for the Super Bowl to play). An obvious optimization is to build a model that considers these events as correlated and dependent.  
* It is possible the problem down into smaller components. Perform the Gathering of Intelligence (statistics), Simulating/Projecting of Patrick Mahomes's stats, Final metric comparison and final analysis communication could be done in several seperate steps. This would ensure that each step's quality is validated before passing on any intelligence and moving onto the next step.  
* Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to simulate Patrick Mahomes's remaining career statistics and achievements. This could create a range of probabalistic outcomes that includes a variety of contraints and rare events. For example, you could simulate Mahomes's career anchored on a typical quaterback aging curve. You could introduce "black swan" (rare) events like major injuries (Robert Griffin), suspensions (Michael Vick) or early retirement (Andrew Luck). 
* Most of these comparison metrics are single point estimations. For example, the AI generated model projects Patrick Mahomes to pass for 600 touchdowns (TDs). An estimate that provides a confidence interval range is a better estimate of uncertainty. As an example, a sophisticated simulation could show a 95% Confidence Interval of Patrick Mahomes ending with a range of 525-650 touchdowns to end his careeer.  
* Tom Brady's career is static and should be just extracted from a "historical ground truth" of statistics, rather than a scraping of web sites. In fact, 5 head-to-head games between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are static as well (unless Tom Brady un-retires). Tom Brady won 3 of those matchups and won 2 of the most important games; AFC Championship and the Super Bowl. These games are in the history books and should be materialized in a knowledge store that is made available for comparison analysis.  

The comparison between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes can be solved using decision-making. This would allow the optimizations mentioned above to be introduced into various components using the Decision Intelligence Framework illustrated below.
