## Intro

The Microsoft Azure platform has been around from it's incarnation in 2008(*) through today. I have been working with cloud services since 2007. In this article & my perspective, I look at the history of Azure and the user interfaces used to manage it and showcase it's features.

## The Beginnings of Azure - Live Mesh

Most people claim that the Microsoft web or Live Search (Bing) that was the starting foundation of the Azure platform. I am making the claim that it was "Live Mesh". This was Ray Ozzie's baby (true CTO of Microsoft at the time) and his team crafted a global & distributed platform for managing/syncing: storage, apps & data on Windows-based devices (2008). What was different from Live Mesh vs the "early Cloud services" at the time was that Microsoft made the promise if you made your application "Live Mesh-enabled" it could connect/sync/communicate/share with hundreds of millions of Microsoft-enabled devices. Doesn't that sound like a current cloud service (except the server component)?
