## An Innovative OpenAI Approach to Crafting a Vector Database in SQL Server and using Semantic Kernel

## Background

Large language models (LLMs) has signaled a transformative shift in artificial intelligence (AI), providing a doorway to tasks rooted in natural language processing. While they are a crucial component of traditional AI, it's important to acknowledge that these models also come with their share of limitations. Their versatility and wide-ranging utility have positioned them as fundamental building blocks for numerous applications, leading some to re-christen them as "foundation models". The scope of this term is extensive, encompassing not only language models but also those trained on a spectrum of data beyond just text. However, this document focuses less on such multimodal models. Additionally, it's critical to approach the label "language model" with some level of skepticism. Although LMs accurately replicate syntax and various linguistic facets, their most compelling attribute is their ability to mirror the world, as characterized by the dataset they are trained on.


the creation of vector databases in SQL Server has been made possible, adding an extra dimension to traditional text analytics. This blog post explores the inner workings of this application and the underlying process.
