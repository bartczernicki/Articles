## An Innovative OpenAI Approach to Crafting a Vector Database in SQL Server and using Semantic Kernel

## Background

Harnessing the power of AI and text analytics to handle large volumes of text data has been a revolutionary stride in data science. With the emergence of OpenAI and the power of embeddings search, now one can craft information retrieval engines that combine private document stores, public or internet knowledge graphs that can be provided as context to LLMs (large language models) to help provide insights and answer questions on 


the creation of vector databases in SQL Server has been made possible, adding an extra dimension to traditional text analytics. This blog post explores the inner workings of this application and the underlying process.
