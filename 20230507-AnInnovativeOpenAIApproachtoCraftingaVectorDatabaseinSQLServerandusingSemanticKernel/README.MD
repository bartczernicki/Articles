## An Innovative OpenAI Approach to Crafting a Vector Database in SQL Server and using Semantic Kernel

## Background

Large language models (LLMs) has signaled a transformative shift in artificial intelligence (AI), providing a doorway to tasks rooted in natural language processing. While they are a crucial component of traditional AI, it's important to acknowledge that these models also come with their share of limitations. Their versatility and wide-ranging utility have positioned them as fundamental building blocks for numerous applications, leading some to re-christen them as "foundation models". Despite their value, current LLMs (including GPT-4)
have inherent limitations:
* Lack of access to current information. For example, many OpenAI models have been trained on data up to September 2021  
* Lack of access to private document stores. For example, OpenAI models were not trained on private corporate contracts  
* Lack of cognitive reasoning. LLMs (including OpenAI) can provide non-sense answers sometimes called "hallucinations"  
* Limited amount of context. Most LLMs have small contexts (memory) that help it remember what topic the chat was about or what the previous chat exchange was  

Good news is that there are approaches to overcome these limitations
