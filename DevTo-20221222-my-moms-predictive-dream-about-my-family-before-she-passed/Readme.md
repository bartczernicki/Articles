In 2017, a few months before my mom passed away, my mom had a dream that in the future my wife and I would have a family consisting of three daughters. I thought this dream prediction an interesting study on "predictive life events", so I decided to write about it and synthesize this with some math & statistical modeling.

In this article, I will cover:
- Most people think that measuring the environment is hard or don't know where to start. I plan to show the reader how to craft simple statistical models using basic statistical rules to quantify (put math labels on) life events. You will see how easily these models can be crafted (even in your head!) and applied to forecasts, predictions and future decision making
- That one doesn't need sophisticated Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Nets for performing accurate forecasts; classic "old school" statistical foundations still apply to a lot of use cases
- Creating statistical models is an exercise in extracting knowledge and information about the environment. Secondly, one will see that predictive modeling is almost an "art" as much it is about the math and statistics
- How "predictive" my mom's dream forecast actually was and what causal conclusions we can draw from these types of life events. For example, does the "supernatural" exist? Did my mom predict the afterlife?

## Background Story

Going back several years to one day in early 2017; I received a call from my parents that my mom had a dream the night prior, that I would have a family with my wife consisting of three daughters. At that time of my mom's predictive dream, my wife and I had been married for 2 years and we had no kids together. We were just starting family planning. My mom had not been well, so I thought this was just one of those "comfort" dreams where my mom was connecting with my "future family" via dreams. Having said that, that day in 2017 I didn't think much of my mom's dream. Fast forward seven years to the end of 2022...I am blessed with a bigger family and **YES, we have three little daughters!!!** Our first daughter was born in 2018, second in 2020 and our third in 2022. Immediately when we found out the gender of our third baby in 2022, I started to think back to my mom's dream and prediction of three daughters. How strange was this? Was this in fact a prediction from the supernatural?

## Calculating the Family Probability of Three Daughters - Part 1 - Naive Approach

Let's tackle the first question. How strange was my mom's predictive dream? Can we put a number on it and in effect measure the probability of my mom being correct? Therefore, what is the probability for having a family of three daughters? In order to calculate this, we can utilize one of the foundational rules of statistics: **"The Statistical Multiplication Rule"**. The statistical multiplication rule, also known as the "rule of product," is a principle in probability that helps to calculate the probability of several events occurring together. It states that the probability of several independent events occurring simultaneously is the product of the probabilities of each event occurring individually.

For example, consider the probability of rolling a "4" on a six-sided die and flipping a coin that lands on heads. The probability of rolling a 4 is 1/6 (one of the six sides of the dice) and the probability of flipping a coin to show heads is 1/2 (50%). Using the statistical multiplication rule, the calculated probability of both of these events occurring together is 1/6 x 1/2 = 1/12 (8.3%). Simple, right? The statistical multiplication rule can be used to calculate the probability of complex events that are composed of multiple independent events.

Using this multiplication rule, we can apply this concept to my mom's dream predicting three daughters to calculate a numeric probability. To keep it simple, let's assume the probability of having a baby daughter [P(Baby Daughter)] is 1/2 (50% [^1]). Furthermore, let's assume having each specific baby gender is an independent event, which means having a prior daughter has no impact on the gender of the future baby. This means that the total probability of having three daughters can simply be calculated by multiplying the independent probability of having a daughter three times. This equates to 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 (or 12.5%).

So, is this it? Well this is a very naive model of the prediction, but a good start. There are several key problems with this simple model, but to highlight a couple issues:
1. The model is already assuming there will be three children. The correct probability statement of the model above should be "Given there are three children, what is the probability that all three would be girls". This is called a conditional probability [^2], as the probability is "conditioned" on the given event occuring.
2. We are missing a great deal of other various independent information that can influence the model of starting a family from scratch. As you can imagine, a mny biologicial/environmental/family events have to "go right" to have a baby.

## Calculating the family Probability of Three Daughters - Part 2 - Improved Model with Selected Independent Events
It turns out the model that we calculated above is quite simple, actually overly optimistic and frankly not quite correct. While it is "roughly true" the probability of a baby daughter is roughly 1/2 (50%), life is much more complex. There is much more information to be added. Going back to my mom's prediction of having a family of three daughters, we should consider the probability (chance) of:
- What if my wife or myself couldn't have kids?
- What if we had one baby, and had "enough" or couldn't handle more than one baby?
- What if our marriage failed (before or during the family process) and ended in divorce?
- What if one of us lost our job and we couldn't afford more children?
- Going more out of the box...What if WW3 started, an asteroid was going to destroy the planet or the universe abruptly ends?

There are almost infinite scenarios to list! This is where the process of **crafting statistical models becomes an exercise in understanding our environment and somewhat of an "art"**!
- Which events should we consider in our model to make proper inferences, claims or forecasts? Events such as WW3 happening or a black hole swallowing up earth will definitely impact family planning, however probably not enough to impact in our statistical model
- More importantly, which of these events are independent? Which ones can we use in our model applying the earlier introduced "the statistical multiplication rule"?

Some of these events are more likely to happen on average (i.e, a divorce, infertility) versus an asteroid/comet impact. All of these events do have a non-zero (>0%) probability of happening even if the probability is super low. The good news is that many of these events have been studied, include many years of empirical data and can simply be looked up. For example, scientists claim an asteroid/comet hitting Earth causing catastrophic impact in a given year is 1 in 300,000 (or 0.0003%). Stating it another way: a 299,999 in 300,000 (or 99.9967%) chance of an asteroid/comet NOT having catastrophic impact in a given year. However, a lot of these event probably shouldn't be taken into consideration into our "statistical family model of three daughters". It is generally accepted to exclude inprobable events from models (i.e, large asteroid/comet hitting Earth) as they do not change the overall "spirit" of the model nor do they change the overall pobability meaningfully. Excluding these events does potentially leave our statistical model susceptible not able to predict "black swan" events. For example, how many business/sales/inventory supply chain/stock market forecasts predicted a global pandemic (black swan event) in 2020? As it turned out, not many at all.

What does our model architecture look like now? The picture below displays the overall structure. The foundation is still the calculation of the probability of having three daughters (given a family of three kids) multiplied by our selected set of independent events. As you can see from the diagram below, the statistical model has now become a synthesis of math & subjectively selected independent events. Note even with some basic events added, the model's probability output has been cut in half to 6.5%. The simple statistical model now has become quite complex, but arguably much more accurate. This is where you can clearly see it is up to the statistician to select the events to add into the model and compose the potential story/narrative that this will ultimately convey; where statistical modeling becomes "art".

The model structure above is meant to be more instructive in nature. An external observer could argue I could have added various more probobalistic events that have high impact potential on having all three daughters such as: chance of getting a serious disease, chance of a serious accident, chance of having a special needs baby etc. In the next section, we will see if we do "better".

## Calculating the Family Probability of Three Daughters - Part 3 - Consolidate Information

Clearly adding many independent events adds inherent complexity to the statistical model. As mentioned earlier, which actual events are added to the model is directly influenced by the statistician in charge. This could greatly effect the predictive power of the statistical model. The second key issue with adding a great deal of independent events is that in pragmatic reality almost no events are truly independent. There is inter-dependence and dependence on multiple events together. For example, the probability of divorce can be influenced if one partner in the relationship can't have children or if one partner can't keep a job. Basically, some partners simply won't stick around through tough times. Another example; what if someone falls seriously ill causing them to lose their job, lose their fertility or lose their partner thus not being able to ever achieve habing 3 children. This is why a great deal of these events are called "naively" independent in the real world.

These events can't simply be implemented without proper due dilligence and understanding the studies associated context.

## Why my Mom didn't Predict Supernatural Existence - Or did She?
If this had been set up as a proper frequentist inference hypothesis experiment, then one could conclude something called **statistical significance**. This is because my mom's predictive dream was so unlikely to happen by chance (1.1%) and it was under a commonly used statistical threshold (5%); 1.1% < 5% thus statistical significance. The terrm **statistical significance** sounds impressive linguisistically, but in reality it does not allow us to claim anything about the environment nor does it prove things like the afterlife or supernatural exiteance. You also probably have heard the term "correlation does not imply causation". While, this model did not perform a correlation exercise with this statitical model the same spirit applies. So, how does one interpret or use a statistical model? In this case, one can use the model created to ask "Is this weird?" and if so, one should investigate further. Based on the model probability, in my opinion one can claim that this predictive dream was highly unlikely due to chance and a further investigation is warranted. So, let's investigate further.

John Allen Paulos is a mathematician and author who has written about the role of probability and statistics in everyday life, including the topic of dreams and their potential relationship to the future. In his book _"A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market"_, Paulos discusses the idea that some people believe dreams can be predictive, offering an example of someone who dreams about a specific stock and then sees that stock rise in value the next day. Paulos notes that while this may seem like a coincidence, it is actually an example of the "law of truly large numbers," which states that with a large enough sample size, any outcome is possible. Paulos goes on to explain that it is natural for people to look for patterns and connections in the world around them, including in their dreams, and that this can lead to the illusion of causality when there is none. In other words, while it may seem like a dream was predictive of a future event, the reality is that the event was likely to happen anyway and the dream was simply a coincidence.

In his book _"Innumeracy"_, Paulos derives a simple statistical model for predictive dreams showing that they are potentially not as rare as people assume. He estimates that on a given night, the probability of a dream having some predictive nature just by random chance is 1/10,000 (0.01%). Highly unlikely, right? However, during the course of a year you have 365 days or chances to have a 0.01% of a predictive dream. This is a little tricky to calculate if you are not versed in some statistics. It is NOT calculated to 365 days * 0.01% = 3.65%. There are several ways to-do this, but one simple way to think about this is using the **Statistics Multiplication Rule**:
- First, set up the solution as a binary event problem. This means that there is an option of a predictive dream or not having a predictive dream in a given day. Basically, there are two possible outcomes: predictive dream or no predictive dream.
- Second, assign probabilities. Since, our system is only two events the probabilities muust add up to 100%. Therefore, the probability of having a predictive dream per day is = 0.01% and the probability of NOT having a predictive dream per day must be 99.99% (100% - 0.01% = 99.99%). 
- Third, use the multiplication rule to calculate the probability over the period. The probability of NOT having a predictive dream in 365 days is simply calculated 99.99% * 99.99% * 99.99% (repeated 365 multiplication times) or 99.99%^365 = 96.4%. This should make sense as time goes on and the period of days becomes larger, the chances of eventually NOT having a predictive dream eventually go down!
- Fourth, now that we have the calculated probability of NOT having a predictive dream in a year (365 days) as 96.4%, we can calculate the probability of having a predictive dream in a year. Using the same compliment rule, if the probability of NOT having even a single predictive dream in a year (365 days) is 96.4%, then the probability of having at least one predictive dream in a year must be the opposite (100% - 96.4% = 3.6%) that ads to 100%; 3.6%.

Therefore, **Paulos claims that in a given year a random human has a 3.6% chance of having at least one predictive dream**. Still a pretty low chance. Now consider this probability over multiple years, all the people you know or all the people in the USA and the probability of a predictive dream actually becomes quite likely. Some examples with calculations:
- In a 20 year period and assuming the probability of having a predictive dream per year is consistently 3.6%; there is a ~52% chance (better than half) that a person will have a predictive dream in a 20 year period. (Note: this is calculated using the technique above or other methods)
- If we know 100 people/aquaintances and assuming the probability of having a predictive dream per year is consistently 3.6%; there is a 97.4% chance that at least one of those 100 people will have had a predictive dream in a given year! (Note: this is calculated using the technique above or other methods)

These predictive dream probabilities become highly un-impressive by the law of large numbers even if we start with a very small probability. So, not very impressive. That is generally the conculsion in most cases. However, there are several huge assumptions and let's play devil's advocate:
- The person is keeping track of their dreams and noting the details. If your aunt or mom is calling you everyday telling you about her various dreams and she hits on an occassional detail that probably isn't very impressive. However, if you get a call out of the blue one day of a predictive dream that happens to be highly detailed and correct...that is a little more "strange" and much less explained by the law of large numbers.
- Predictive dreams are usually relayed in a past sense. For example, say you get that big promotion for a job and you call your parents to share the good news; then your mom says...I dreamt that last week that you would get a promotion. A lot less impressive for someone to say "I knew that was going to happen" after it happens.
- Finally, most predictive dreams have little substantiative detail and are loosely interpreted as predictive. A great example is Nostradamus, astrology or a fortune cookie where the details are quite squishy and could apply to many things in one's life
