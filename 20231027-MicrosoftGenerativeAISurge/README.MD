## Intro

2023 is the year of "Generative AI"!! Many companies including Microsoft are all-in in crafting new platforms, services, solutions, offers hoping it is the next big "growth engine" for years to come. Specifically, for Microsoft there is a tsunami of new innovations hitting the market and not just from the "Microsoft" brand either. To get a complete grasp of Microsoft's current AI strategy and upcoming innovations with Generative AI for early 2024, consider consuming the content from the conferences listed below. In these conferences, Microsoft either owns or co-owns AI intellectual property. Also, AI was either the main theme or a sub-theme in these four recent conferences:

- [OpenAI DevDay 2023](https://devday.openai.com/) – November 6th, 2023
- [GitHub Universe 2023](https://githubuniverse.com/) – November 8th – 9th 2023
- [Microsoft Ignite 2023](https://ignite.microsoft.com/) – November 14th – 17th 2023
- [.NET Conf 2023](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) – November 14th – 16th 2023

## OpenAI DevDay 2023

OpenAI DevDay 2023 was a developer conference hosted by OpenAI on November 6, 2023, in San Francisco. OpenAI is a separate company from Microsoft, however Microsoft does own a significant stake in the "for profit" component of OpenAI. Therefore, the innovations and advancements announced from OpenAI usually will make it to Microsoft Azure. So, this conference is an excellent event to gauge what is coming to Microsoft Azure AI in the next few weeks/months.

Some of the highlights of the conference were:

- **Performance** : .NET 8 has seen many improvements in performance across the entire stack, such as faster startup, lower memory usage, better code generation, and more. In fact, over 1,500 commits have been made to make .NET 8 the fastest .NET. Obviously, you will want these new AI applications to perform as optimized they can be! To highlight one AI specific example .NET 8 includes CPU accelerations to perform vector math much faster. [The conference showcased some of the benchmarks and best practices for optimizing .NET applications for performance](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda).
- **AI and Machine Learning** : .NET 8 introduces several new features and enhancements for building intelligent applications with AI and machine learning, such as ChatGPT integration, Stable Diffusion support, prompt engineering, custom GPTs, and more. The Semantic Kernel library is close to v1.0 release and Machine Learning v3.0 was released as well. [The conference demonstrated how to use these features with the Azure OpenAI service, ML.NET, and ONNX Runtime](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/category/aiml/).
- **General Development Features** : .NET 8 also brings many new and improved features for general development, such as C# 10, F# 6, Visual Studio 2022, .NET MAUI, Blazor Full Stack, Copilot and more. [The conference explored how to use these features to create modern, cross-platform, and full-stack applications with .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-conf-2023-celebrating-the-release-of-dotnet-8-save-the-date/).
