Measuring sales performance is a crucial aspect of running a successful business. Accurately tracking and analyzing sales data helps companies understand their strengths and weaknesses, perform forecasts, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth. In this article, I will illuminate how some simple statistical models can be used for measuring sales performance. Whether you are part of small or enterprise sales team, these simple quantitative techniques can be used to provide valuable sales insights.

## Price's Law - Your Top Sales Performers Likely Account for 50% of your Sales Output

![Sales Price's Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesPricesLaw.png)

**Price's Law[^1]** is a statistical principle that describes the distribution of productivity in organizations. It states that a small proportion of employees will produce a disproportionately large amount of output. In the context of sales performance, this law suggests that a small number of salespeople will be responsible for a significant portion of total sales. According to **Price's Law[^1]**, approximately 50% of the total output of a sales team will be generated by the square root of the total number of employees in the team. For example, if a sales team has 100 members, approximately 10 of them will generate 50% of the total sales.

One quick way to operationalize **Price's Law** for sales performance is to use it to understand that a sales organization will naturally skew sales outcomes to the top performers. This is to the nature of how sales accounts are allocated, the manifestation of "luck versus skill" and other conventions that govern sales. Furthermore, this principle has important implications for sales performance management. By understanding Price's Law, sales managers can focus their efforts on identifying and supporting the top-performing salespeople, who are likely to have the greatest impact on sales results. Additionally, Price's Law can be used to identify areas for improvement in sales performance. For example, if a large portion of sales are generated by a small number of salespeople, the manager may focus on developing and implementing training programs to improve the performance of the rest of the team.

**Price's Law** is one of the main reasons large organizations split up their sales teams into various areas. For example, you may have a sales team focused on various technology domains, geographical regions or even industry verticals. This allows multiple top-performing teams to foster success.

It's important to note that while **Price's Law** can provide useful insights into sales performance, it's a statistical principle and should not be used as a rigid rule or the sole measure of sales performance. Other factors, such as market conditions, customer behavior, and product features, can also impact sales results and should be considered in performance evaluations.
