Measuring sales performance is a crucial aspect of running a successful business. Accurately tracking and analyzing sales data helps companies understand their strengths and weaknesses, perform forecasts, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth. In this article, I will illuminate how some simple statistical models can be used for measuring sales performance. Whether you are part of small or enterprise sales team, these simple quantitative techniques can be used to provide valuable sales insights.

## Price's Law - Top Sales Performers Account for 50% of Sales Output

![Sales Price's Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesPricesLaw.png)

**Price's Law**[^2] is a statistical principle that describes the distribution of productivity in organizations. It states that a small proportion of employees will produce a disproportionately large amount of output. In the context of sales performance, this law suggests that a small number of salespeople will be responsible for a significant portion of total sales. According to **Price's Law**[^2], approximately 50% of the total output of a sales team will be generated by the square root of the total number of employees in the team. For example, if a sales team has 100 members, approximately 10 of them will generate 50% of the total sales. Conversely, if a sales team is large 10,000 about 100 sales people will account for 50% of the sales outcomes. This means that **Price's Law** estimates scales down performance as the size of the sales team increases. To state this another way:  
- In a sales team consisting of 100 sales members, 10 sales members will account for 50% of outcome; 10% of the sale force.
- In a sales team consisting of 1,000 sales members, 32 sales members will account for 50% of outcome; 3.2% of the sale force.
- In a sales team consisting of 10,000 sales members, 100 sales members will account for 50% of outcome; 1% of the sale force!

The larger the sales team, less of them are contributing to the overall success. **Price's Law** is one of the core reasons enterprise organizations split up their sales teams into various sales areas. For example, you may have a sales team focused on various technology domains, geographical regions or even industry verticals. This allows multiple top-performing teams to emerge across various sub sales areas. 

Another quick way to operationalize **Price's Law**[^2] for sales performance is to use it to understand that a sales organization will naturally skew sales outcomes to the top performers. This is attributed to the nature of how sales accounts are allocated, the manifestation of "luck versus skill" and other conventions that govern sales. Furthermore, this principle has important implications for sales performance management. By understanding Price's Law, sales managers can focus their efforts on identifying and supporting the top-performing salespeople, who are likely to have the greatest impact on sales results. Additionally, Price's Law can be used to identify areas for improvement in sales performance. For example, if a large portion of sales are generated by a small number of salespeople, the manager may focus on developing and implementing training programs to improve the performance of the rest of the team.

It is important to note that while **Price's Law** can provide useful insights into sales performance, it's a statistical principle and should not be used as a rigid rule or the sole measure of sales performance. Other factors, such as market conditions, customer behavior, and product features, can also impact sales results and should be considered in sales performance evaluations.
