Measuring sales performance is a crucial aspect of running a successful business. Accurately tracking and analyzing sales data helps companies understand their strengths and weaknesses, perform forecasts, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth. In this article, I will illuminate how some simple statistical models can be used for measuring sales performance. Whether it is a small or enterprise sales team, simple quantitative techniques can be used to provide valuable sales insights or draw attention to areas of need. **After reading this article, you will see various examples how simple models are applied in real life scenarios.**

## Price's Law - Top Sales Performers Account for 50% of Sales Output

![Sales Price's Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesPricesLaw.png)

**Price's Law**[^2] is a statistical principle that describes the distribution of productivity in organizations. It states that a small proportion of employees will produce a disproportionately large amount of output. In the context of sales performance, this law suggests that a small number of salespeople will be responsible for a significant portion of total sales. According to **Price's Law**[^2], approximately 50% of the total output of a sales team will be generated by the square root of the total number of employees in the team. For example, if a sales team has 100 members, approximately 10 of them will generate 50% of the total sales. Conversely, if a sales team is large 10,000 about 100 sales people will account for 50% of the sales outcomes. This means that **Price's Law** estimates overall top performance drops as the size of the sales team increases! To state this another way:  
- In a sales team consisting of 100 sales members, 10 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 10% of the sale force are top performers.
- In a sales team consisting of 1,000 sales members, 32 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 3.2% of the sale force are top performers.
- In a sales team consisting of 10,000 sales members, 100 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 1% of the sale force are top performers!

Bascially, with a larger the sales team structure, less of them are contributing to the overall success. **Price's Law** is one of the core reasons enterprise organizations split up their sales teams into various sales areas. For example, you may have a sales team focused on various technology domains, geographical regions or even industry verticals. This allows multiple top-performing teams to emerge across various sub sales areas. 

Another quick way to operationalize **Price's Law**[^2] for sales performance is to use it to understand that a sales organization will naturally skew sales outcomes to the top performers. This is attributed to the nature of how sales accounts are allocated, the manifestation of "luck versus skill" and other conventions that govern sales. Furthermore, this principle has important implications for sales performance management. By understanding Price's Law, sales managers can focus their efforts on identifying and supporting the top-performing salespeople, who are likely to have the greatest impact on sales results. Additionally, Price's Law can be used to identify areas for improvement in sales performance. For example, if a large portion of sales are generated by a small number of salespeople, the manager may focus on developing and implementing training programs to improve the performance of the rest of the team.

It is important to note that while **Price's Law** can provide useful insights into sales performance, it's a statistical principle and should not be used as a rigid rule or the sole measure of sales performance. Other factors, such as market conditions, customer behavior, and product features, can also impact sales results and should be considered in sales performance evaluations.


## Regression to the Mean - That new Rockstar Salesperson will likely perform closer to the Historical Sales Average

![Sales - Regression to the Mean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesRegressionToMean.png)

**Regression to the mean**[^4] is a statistical phenomenon where the average of a population is calculated as the expected value of the population, and outliers (values that are much higher or lower than the average) tend to return towards the average in the long run.  

In the context of hiring a new salesperson, **regression to the mean** can come into play when a new hire has a history of exceptional sales performance. If the new hire's sales quota is based solely on this past performance, it's possible that their future performance will not match their previous success. This is because their past performance was likely influenced by various factors such as luck, temporary market conditions, and other external circumstances. For example, if a new salesperson has previously exceeded their sales quota by 100%, it's unlikely that they will always consistently perform at this level going forward. Instead, their future performance is likely to return closer to the average of the sales team, and possibly even below the average. This is regression to the mean at work.  

There is a super simple statistical regression formula (illustrated below) that can be used. Many studies show that cognitive correlation regarding performance is usually less than 30% (0.3). This means that using a job interview as the key driver of future performance will likely explain 30% of future performance. In fact, numerous studies have shown that less than 3% of the time will there be a 50% correlation or more on future performance from a single cognitive driver like a job interview. You need more factors to judge future performance.

In the job interview scenario shown above:  
- A new "rockstar salesperson" interviews for a sales position. A sales leader estimates that they will produce triple than the current team
- If an average sales performance is $1 million/year, doubling this "rockstar salesperson's" performance would be $3 million/year
- The regression to the mean formula states that it is more likely this "rockstar salesperson" will be closer to the average and not optimistic outlier. Their sales performance should be estimated closer to the average: $1 million/year + $2 million/year * 30% = $1.6 million/year
- The sales leader can still account for the salesperson to perform considerably better, but **regression to the mean** calibrates the estimate conservatively

To avoid making an overly optimistic sales forecast for a new salesperson, it's important to consider multiple factors when assigning a performance quota, such as the salesperson's skills, experience, and the market conditions that they will be operating in. However, when considering one main factor (job interview/resume) it is best to calibrate the performance expecations closer to the average. This can help to ensure that the new hire's sales performance is sustainable and in line with expectations.  


## Law of Large Numbers - Consistent Patterns & Trends will emerge with enough Sales Engagements

![Sales - Law of Large Numbers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesLawOfLargeNumbers.png)

**The law of large numbers**[^5] is a statistical concept that states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample approaches the population mean. In the context of sales processes, the law of large numbers can be used to find trends and make more accurate predictions about future sales performance or the "ground truth" performance of sales. For example, if a company wants to predict the average daily sales for a new product, it can collect data on the sales of that product over a period of time and use that data to calculate the average daily sales. The longer the period of time for which data is collected, the larger the sample size and the more reliable the average will be as an indicator of future sales performance. This allows for much better forecasting.

In addition to predicting future sales performance, the **law of large numbers** can also be used to identify trends in sales processes. For example, if a company notices that sales are consistently higher on certain days of the week or during certain months of the year, it can use this information to make strategic decisions about product promotions, staffing levels, and other factors that affect sales.

It's important to keep in mind that the **law of large numbers** only works if the metrics you're tracking don't change a lot from one time to the next. For example, if the number of sales changes a lot from month to month, it will be harder to see a clear trend. That's why it's important to keep track of your sales over a long time, and to be careful when interpreting the results.


## Statistical Distributions - How Negative Binomial Can be used to Measure Call Center Sales Goals

![Sales - Call Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/Articles/main/20230129-MeasuringSalesPerformanceUsingSimpleStatisticalModels/Image-SalesCallCenter.png)

There are various stastical distributions that have a small set of parameters that are very effective tools in estimating processes. One such distribution is the negative binomial distribution. A **negative binomial distribution**[^6] is a way to understand what happens when you're counting a certain number of events, but the number of events you need to observe is unknown (and you need to predict it). In the context of sales performance, you can use a negative binomial distribution to make predictions about the number of sales you'll make and given the amount of sales attempts it will take, given consistent performance number.  

To use a negative binomial distribution, you need to know two things: the number of desired successful sales and the consistent probability of making a sale. You can use past sales data to find the average number of successful sales, and use market research or other information to estimate the probability of making a sale.  With this information, you can make predictions about the number of sales you'll make. Assume the following call center sales scenario:
- There is a sales bonus given out every month if a salesperson closes 20 deals in a month in a call center
- The probability of closing a sales deal is consistently shows a 10% probability from a sales call; every sales call there is a 1 in 10 chance of closing business
- How many sales calls does the salesperson need to make to earn the monthly sales bonus?

Using an **online negative binomial calculator**[^7], it can probalistically estimated that in order to close 10 deals in a month from a 10% sales converstion:  
- 1.6%  probabability it will take up to 100 sales calls to achieve the monthly sales bonus
- 25.5% probabability it will take up to 150 sales calls to achieve the monthly sales bonus
- 70.6% probabability it will take up to 200 sales calls to achieve the monthly sales bonus

It is probably common sense that more sales calls will help achieve the desired sales conversion number. However, the **negative binomial distribution** helps illuminate the exact numbers and put probabilities on those numbers. This provides incredible amount of information for the call center of the sales individual to plan their monthly success accordingly.
