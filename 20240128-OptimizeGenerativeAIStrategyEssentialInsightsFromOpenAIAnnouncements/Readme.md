## Intro

On January 25th, 2024 OpenAI made several key announcements that should be used to extract several emerging patterns that can be applied to a Generative AI (or AI) strategy. What key innnovations did OpenAI announce?  

- Two new embedding models, with fluid dimension sizes & pricing options  
- An updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model  
- An updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model, with reduced pricing  
- An updated text moderation model

In this article, I will uncover how these seemingly simple announcements uncover several important patterns in the Generative AI space that every person crafting an Generative AI strategy should be aware of.

## 1) Competitive Descent in Generative AI Pricing

The competition for Generative AI & Artificial Intelligence overall is hitting a frenzy phase. Seemingly every company is looking to Generative AI as a potential huge growth driver for years to come. Some companies are well ahead in executing their AI strategy; others like Google, Meta (Facebook), Apple are going through massive re-orgs, re-locations (Apple), unlocking financial capital for future AI investments. All one has todo is follow the stock price of public companies on the stock market and one can see a dramatic rise reflected in AI investments. For example, at the time of this writing IBM's stock was up over 13% in one day, because of blowout earnings forecasts driven by generative AI. History has repeatedly shown that Generative AI is not going to be unique as the competitive market forms.

I would like to focus on what I call the "Competitive Descent in Generative AI Pricing". In my opinion, price history will repeat itself like any past set of technology innovations some like to call "the race to the bottom". Let's highlight a key OpenAI (01.25) announcement around the reduction of the price of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from $0.001 to $0.0005 per (1K tokens). From a historical perspective this amounts to:  
- Mar '23: $0.002 (initial availability)  
- Jul '23: $0.0015 (-25%)  
- Nov '23: $0.001 (-33%)  
- Jan '24: $0.0005 (-50%)

**Basically, the latest GPT-3.5 Turbo model(s) are 4x cheaper than they were just 9 months ago!** In my personal opinion, we are in the early throes of the Generative AI price decline that typically will follow a steep decline follow by a "floor" (logarithmic decreasing function).  Let's take a look from a similar innovation like "cloud blob storage" and the price decline that had occuredd. The figure below ([full article from Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/industry/cloud-storage-fee-inflation/)) showcases the steep price declines across several cloud hyperscalars over roughly four (4) years until prices stabalized very cleanly over the last dozen years.

So, what is the impact on your Generative AI strategy? Should you wait 4-5 years until Generative AI competition potentially drastically lowers prices? Of course not, as you could be losing valuable industry opportunity or risking your competition unlocking generative AI to get ahead in the market. The approach should be to carefully select AI vendors & partners that can provide fluid pricing options that allow your business to thrive with Generative AI potential. Even if your business's technology strategy is to leverage open-source AI models, those could end up costing much more than commercial alternatives. Pricing should be at forefront in making AI strategic decisions.

## 3) Embedding Sizes are a key Architecture Decision  

## 4) Coming to Azure OpenAI  

## 5) Not all Innovations initiate from OpenAI
