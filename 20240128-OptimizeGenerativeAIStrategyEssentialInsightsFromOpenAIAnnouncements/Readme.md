## Intro

On January 25th, 2024 OpenAI made several key announcements that can be used to extract several patterns that can be used when formulating a Generative AI (or AI) strategy. What innnovations did OpenAI announce?  

- Two new embedding models, with fluid dimension sizes & pricing options  
- An updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model  
- An updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model, with reduced pricing  
- An updated text moderation model

In this article, I will uncover how these seemingly simiple announcements show several important patterns in the Generative AI space that every person crafting an Generative AI strategy should be aware of.

## 1) Competitive Descent in Generative AI Pricing

The competition for Generative AI & Artificial Intelligence holistically is hitting a frenzy phase. Seemingly, every company is looking to Generative AI as a potential huge growth driver for years to come. Some companies are well ahead in executing their AI strategy; others like Google, Meta (Facebook), Apple are going through massive re-orgs, re-locations (Apple), unlocking financial capital for future AI investments. History has repeatedly shown that Generative AI is not going to be unique as the competitive market forms.

I would like to focus on what I call the "Competitive Descent in Generative AI Pricing". In my opinion, price history will repeat itself like any past set of technology innovations some like to call "the race to the bottom". Let's highlight a key OpenAI (01.25) announcement around the reduction of the price of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from $0.001 to $0.0005 per (1K tokens). From a historical perspective this amounts to:  
- Mar '23: $0.002 (initial availability)  
- Jul '23: $0.0015 (-25%)  
- Nov '23: $0.001 (-33%)  
- Jan '24: $0.0005 (-50%)  
Basically, the latest GPT-3.5 Turbo model(s) are 4x cheaper than they were just 9 months ago.  

## 2) Model Versions Matter  

## 3) Embedding Sizes are a key Architecture Decision  

## 4) Coming to Azure OpenAI  

## 5) Not all Innovations initiate from OpenAI
